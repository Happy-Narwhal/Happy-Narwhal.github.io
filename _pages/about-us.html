                    We’ll help you to understand the technical requirements,
                    and if we don’t think we’re a good fit for your project we’ll be upfront about it.

Happy Narwhal is both a small company and a network of people in the tech space.
Our origins lie in Mankato, MN. Feel free to connect if you're a programmer or designer and interested in working together.
Depending on the needs of your project, we can call upon other alumni from Launch Academy and tech communities we're apart of.
