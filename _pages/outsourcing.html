  <h2>Why Outsource With Us?</h2>
  <br><br>
  <div class='col-md-3 col-6'><h3>Direct Access to Talent:</h3>
    Spending much of my time in the Philippines allows me to build strong local networks and connect you directly to junior developers, programming interns, and virtual assistants.
  </div>
  <div class='col-md-3 col-6'><h3>Significant Cost Savings:</h3>
    You can expect to pay <em>4-8x less</em> compared to US-based developers.
    Virtual assistant rates typically range from <strong>$1.50/hr to $3.50/hr</strong>,
    depending on English fluency and relevant experience.
  </div>
  <div class='col-md-3 col-6'><h3>AI-Enhanced Support:</h3>
    Virtual assistants can be trained to help you with data entry or use AI to
    generate content like images, music, and copy — perfect for game development,
    e-commerce, or marketing workflows.
  </div>
  <div class='col-md-3 col-6'><h3>Flexible Engagements:</h3>
    Whether you need help with sourcing, onboarding, or ongoing management, I
    can offer different levels of support. Please <a href="#contact">reach out</a>
    for more details and custom arrangements.

    <h2>What to Expect</h2>
    <p>Outsourcing can unlock significant advantages, but it comes with unique challenges. Setting the right expectations is key to success.</p>
    <ul class='bullet'>
        <li><strong>Language Proficiency:</strong> Communication skills vary—some candidates have basic proficiency while others are near-fluent. Clear communication and patience are essential.</li>
        <li><strong>Educational Gaps:</strong> Local education quality can differ from Western standards. Junior devs may need more coaching to meet your quality benchmarks.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong Leadership is Key:</strong> Remote junior developers thrive when paired with clear leadership, good processes, and regular oversight. This is where I can advise or help build your internal systems to support them.</li>
    </ul>
