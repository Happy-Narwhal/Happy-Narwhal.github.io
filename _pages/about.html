          <h3>Bjorn Linder</h3>
          <p>Hi, I’m Bjorn. I’ve been building web applications for years,
            working on everything from SaaS tools to e-commerce sites to game
            prototypes. I’ve worked with startups, e-commerce companies, and
            SaaS platforms, helping them design better systems and bring ideas to life.</p>

          <p>I specialize in Ruby on Rails but I’m also comfortable helping
            teams out with other technologies. These days, I’m especially
            interested in using AI to speed up development and help teams work
            smarter, not harder.</p>
