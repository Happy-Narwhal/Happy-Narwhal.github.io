        <h3>Bjorn Linder</h3>
        <p>Hi, I’m Bjorn. I’ve been building web applications for years,
          working on everything from SaaS tools to e-commerce sites to game
          prototypes. I’ve worked with startups, e-commerce companies, and
          SaaS platforms, helping them design better systems and bring ideas to life.</p>

        <p>I specialize in Ruby on Rails but I’m also comfortable helping
          teams out with other technologies. These days, I’m especially
          interested in using AI to speed up development and help teams work
          smarter, not harder.</p>
