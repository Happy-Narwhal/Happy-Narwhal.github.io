        <h3>PROTOTYPING</h3>
        <p>Using AI to quickly generate a simple website, mobile app, or game. We
          can work on it together, or if you want to dive into it yourself, check out
          <a href="https://hostinger.com?REFERRALCODE=VV4BJORNI27I">Hostinger Horizons</a> or
          <a href="https://replit.com/refer/happynarwhal">Replit</a> (referral links included).</p>
        <p>Test ideas. Validate assumptions.</p>

        <h3>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <p>Custom web applications designed for the best user experience.
          We'll design and build static webpages, online stores, and custom applications.</p>
          <p>For more complex applications, I'm most experienced working with Rails.
            If that's not the right fit for your project, I'm open to pointing you in other directions.</p>

        <h3>GAME DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <p>Open to working on games with Godot or JavaScript.
          Options range from generating a quick prototype/MVP to more complex games with database and server setup.
          Samples coming soon! We're currently in the early stages of 4x and reverse TD games.</p>

    <p>
      I offer flexible support tailored to your project’s needs. Whether you’re looking
      for hands-on development, strategic guidance, or help assembling and managing a
      team — we can chart a path that works for you. </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Initial Consultation:</strong> We’ll explore your goals, your team’s strengths, and where I can help. If you're interested we can also start on some prototyping right away.</li>
      <li><strong>Tech Strategy & Hiring Support:</strong> I can advise on your tech stack, AI integration options, and help you find or vet developers and contractors.</li>
      <li><strong>Development & Prototyping:</strong> For some projects, I may take a hands-on role, building prototypes or key components myself.</li>
      <li><strong>Ongoing Collaboration:</strong> I can remain available for check-ins, troubleshooting, or periodic strategic reviews as your project evolves.</li>
    </ol>
