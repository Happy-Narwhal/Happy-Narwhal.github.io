        <h2>Why Choose AI-Powered Development?</h2>
        <p>
          AI accelerates software development—cutting costs, reducing guesswork, and helping ideas come to life faster. It’s not about replacing developers—it’s about making your team faster, smarter, and more efficient.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Faster iteration:</strong> Rapid prototyping with AI tools means we can test ideas quickly and adjust based on real feedback.</li>
          <li><strong>Smarter builds:</strong> We use AI to automate boilerplate and generate working components, letting us focus on what really matters.</li>
          <li><strong>Human-in-the-loop:</strong> AI doesn’t replace human judgment. I guide teams to use AI effectively, with careful oversight at every step.</li>
        </ul>
