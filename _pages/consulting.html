<h2>From Vision to Team: Technical & Strategic Guidance for Early-Stage Startups</h2>

<div id="wrapper">

          <p>I work with founders to shape ideas into viable, buildable products—helping you define a clear technical direction, assemble the right team, and get you set up for long-term success.</p>
          <p>With a background in software development and an MBA, I bring a mix of practical engineering insight and strategic thinking to the table. Whether you're pre-MVP or scaling your first users, I can help.</p>
        </div>

          <b>Before you build, you need to know what to build—and why. I help early-stage startups:</b>
          <ul class='bullet'>
            <li>Shape and refine your product vision into something buildable, useful, and testable</li>
            <li>Assess the viability of your idea from a product-market fit and operational standpoint</li>
            <li>Choose the right development approach—whether that’s code, no-code, or AI-assisted prototyping</li>
            <li>Identify risks and assumptions early, so you can move faster with fewer surprises</li>
            <li>Consider early go-to-market and messaging strategy, especially if you’re tight on resources</li>
          </ul>

📐 Product & Strategy Guidance

<p>You don’t need a huge team to get clarity. You just need the right conversations early on.</p>

<h2>Technical Advisory & Stack Planning</h2>
I specialize in helping startups:

<li>Choose the right tech stack based on your product goals, budget, and future team</li>
<li>Avoid costly missteps like over-engineering or committing to the wrong tools too early</li>
<li>Plan for realistic scaling based on what you can actually maintain</li>

👥 Hiring & Team Building Support
Your first hires matter more than your tech stack. I support founders by:

<li>Refining technical roles and job listings that match product needs and business goals</li>
<li>Vetting developers, freelancers, or firms (including outsourcing options)</li>
<li>Structuring and optimizing team workflows that support fast iteration and clarity</li>
<li>Stepping in as a fractional tech lead while you build out your full team</li>
