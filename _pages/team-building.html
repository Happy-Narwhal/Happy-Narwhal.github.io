                Hiring developers is a significant investment in both time and money.
                At the end of the day what matters is the expected lifetime value you believe a candidate will provide relative to the cost.
                We can even weigh in intangible factors like cultural fit, that may weigh the scales one way or another.
                Depending on your company and the role you may be more or less concerned with long term value; for instance the value of long-term contribution and candidate potential is minimized for contract roles compared to full-time positions.

              Rapid prototyping
              Rails is a strong framework enabling rapid application prototyping.
              Basic application structure (CRUD methods, database connectivity) can be generated easily with a relatively low amount of time in writing code.

              <h2>Technical Advisory & Stack Planning</h2>
              I specialize in helping startups:

              <li>Choose the right tech stack based on your product goals, budget, and future team</li>
              <li>Avoid costly missteps like over-engineering or committing to the wrong tools too early</li>
              <li>Plan for realistic scaling based on what you can actually maintain</li>

              <li>Shape and refine your product vision into something buildable, useful, and testable</li>
              <li>Consider early go-to-market and messaging strategy, especially if you’re tight on resources</li>
              <li>Identify risks and assumptions early, so you can move faster with fewer surprises</li>




                <li>Refining technical roles and job listings that match product needs and business goals</li>
                <li>Vetting developers, freelancers, or firms (including outsourcing options)</li>

    <h2>Why Choose AI-Powered Development?</h2>
    <p>
      AI accelerates software development—cutting costs, reducing guesswork, and helping ideas come to life faster. It’s not about replacing developers—it’s about making your team faster, smarter, and more efficient.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Faster iteration:</strong> Rapid prototyping with AI tools means we can test ideas quickly and adjust based on real feedback.</li>
      <li><strong>Smarter builds:</strong> We use AI to automate boilerplate and generate working components, letting us focus on what really matters.</li>
      <li><strong>Human-in-the-loop:</strong> AI doesn’t replace human judgment. I guide teams to use AI effectively, with careful oversight at every step.</li>
    </ul>
