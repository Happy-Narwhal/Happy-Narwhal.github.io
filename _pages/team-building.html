                Hiring developers is a significant investment in both time and money.
                At the end of the day what matters is the expected lifetime value you believe a candidate will provide relative to the cost.
                We can even weigh in intangible factors like cultural fit, that may weigh the scales one way or another.
                Depending on your company and the role you may be more or less concerned with long term value; for instance the value of long-term contribution and candidate potential is minimized for contract roles compared to full-time positions.

              Rapid prototyping
              Rails is a strong framework enabling rapid application prototyping.
              Basic application structure (CRUD methods, database connectivity) can be generated easily with a relatively low amount of time in writing code.
